### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Spencer Hadel, and I'm a data scientist and recent Flatiron School graduate! I've spent my adult life until this point working in the food service industry, and am excited to use my newfound skills to create more of an impact on the world I live in. A natural with computers and technology, I take pride in learning new tools and programming languages quickly, and in helping others learn as well.

I look forward to being able to apply my skills and aptitude to projects that can really make some changes for the better, and I can't wait to connect with others that feel the same way!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finding a career that aligns with my passion!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning/re-learning SQL, R, and Tableau to complement my existing data science knowledge in Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects with the potential for social impact!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience with Natural Language Processing and Convolutional Neural Networks
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking for help with discovering more ways to make an impact with data science!
- ðŸ—½ Based in New York City
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His
